### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current state of the project ‚ö†Ô∏è

I haven't been posting updates since some days because I'm working on a V2 written in [V](https://github.com/vlang/v)! The current project is pretty usable but, the speed isn't good enough. For a casual website that's good but for a search engine it isn't satisfying enough. I'm also currently blocked by a [bug/feature in V itself](https://github.com/vlang/v/issues/10683).

### *This project is at an early stage!*

## Goals

- Based on Google to get best results
- Beautiful UI and innovative UX
- Privacy respecting (no cookies, no link-tracking, random user-agent, etc.)
- No ads
- Proxy support (maybe Tor too in the future)
- Optional customization

<i><b>Non-goal</b>: support old, or even not so old, browsers</i>

## Usage

### Quickly test it

You can quickly test it on my instances, just remember to only use it for testing proposes as they may be unavailable during some dev sessions:

- <https://goodgle.up.railway.app>
- <https://goodgle-hunam6.cloud.okteto.net>
