## This project is at a very early stage!

### Goals

- Based on Google so really good results
- Beautiful UI and innovative UX
- Privacy respecting (random user-agent etc)
- No ads
- Proxy support (maybe Tor too in the future)
- Customizable but requiring almost no or no configuration (simple to use)

### Documentation

For now just run `deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env --unstable app.ts`

### Contributing

Hi and welcome! Contributing is very welcome! Every type of contribution is welcomed, just remember to follow the [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines).

*PS: if you don't know where to start look at all the "TODO" comments (I recommend Todo Tree for VSCode).*
